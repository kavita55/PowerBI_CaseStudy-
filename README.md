## Introduction

Power BI is a powerful business analytics tool developed by Microsoft that allows you to visualize and share insights from your data. This repository hosts a variety of Power BI projects that cover different industries, data sources, and visualization techniques. Each project is designed to help you understand how to create compelling dashboards, perform data transformations, and showcase meaningful insights to drive better decision-making.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

1. **Customer Classification**: We will explore how to perform customer classification using Power BI's Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) language and the Transform Data function.
2. **NYC Vehicle Collision**: To identify critical locations for collisions, and try to prevent accidents in the future.


Each project folder contains the Power BI file, along with any associated data files or documentation required to understand the context and data sources used.
